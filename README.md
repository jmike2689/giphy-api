# giphy-api

Here is a Giphy API project which required me to utilize my own API key generated from the Giphy Developers website. On this application, you'll be able to click on any set button to see 10 gifs that are related. You are able to add whatever topic/button you'd like. Your new button, once clicked, will generate gifs of their own towards the bottom of the page.
